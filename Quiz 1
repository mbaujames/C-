Question 1
using c#, write a code for a guessing game. the game should; 
give players 3 lives; 
it should be played among 2 players in which one player sets the words and a hint while the second player guesses the word, 
it should at least have 3 levels: 
level one to have 3 words,
level two to have 4 words and 
level 3 to have 5 words. 
the game should be played a maximum of 5 times and the score in terms of percentage is computed and displayed

ANS:

using System;

class GuessingGame

            int level = currentGame % 3 + 1; // Cycle through levels 1, 2, 3
            int wordsCount = level + 2; // Levels 1, 2, 3 have 3, 4, 5 words respectively

            string[] words = GetWordsFromPlayer(wordsCount);
            string hint = GetHintFromPlayer();

            Console.WriteLine("\nPlayer 2, it's your turn to guess!");
